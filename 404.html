        <p>Subnodal has changed a lot since it was founded in 2018. As of 2024, Subnodal is getting a reboot, which means that it is experiencing many drastic and exciting changes to its mission and scope â€” but it also means that we have had to close some of our older projects to make way for new ones. This is likely why this page no longer exists (if it existed in the first place).</p>
        <p>If you're desperately looking for some of our older content, we've tried our best to archive our website's content at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/subnodal.com">web.archive.org</a> and <a href="https://archive.today/akejo">archive.today</a>.</p>
